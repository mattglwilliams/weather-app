# Weather Forecast App

For this project, I have created an [application](https://mattglwilliams.github.io/weather-app/) that gets the weather forecast for both the current day and the following 5 days for the city you have searched for. This app is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and utilises the data from the API's Moment.JS and the OpenWeatherAPI.

Below, you can see what the website looks like on load. As you can see, it has a header and an input & search button where a user can enter the city they want to search for.

Below, is how the page looks once you have searched for a city. Firstly, it loads the current days forecast, including the city and the date, an icon summarising the weather, the temp, wind speed, humidity and the UV index. Next, it loads a 5 day forecast that shows the date, an icon summarising the weather, the temp, wind speed and humidity. it also saves previous searches and these are clickable and will load the data for that specific city.
